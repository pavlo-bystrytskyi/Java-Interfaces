//Step 1: Define an interface 'Playable' that contains a method 'play' without implementation.

//Step 2: Create a class 'MusicPlayer' that implements the 'Playable' interface. Implement the 'play' method to play a song.

//Step 3: Create a class 'VideoPlayer' that also implements the 'Playable' interface. Implement the 'play' method to play a video.

//Step 4: Create a class 'MediaController' that contains a method 'playMedia'. This method should accept a 'Playable' object as a parameter and invoke the 'play' method.

// Step 5: In the 'main' method, initialize an object of the 'MusicPlayer' and 'VideoPlayer' classes with the 'Playable' interface (polymorphism).

//Step 6: In the 'main' method, create an object of the 'MediaController' class and use it to play both a song and a video.
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MediaController mediaController = new MediaController();
        Playable musicPlayer = new MusicPlayer();
        Playable videoPlayer = new VideoPlayer();
        mediaController.playMedia(musicPlayer);
        mediaController.playMedia(videoPlayer);
    }
